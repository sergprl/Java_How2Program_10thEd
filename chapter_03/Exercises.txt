The keyword "new" tells java to save space in memory for a new object. It also calls the constructor of the 
object's class in order to create an instance of the object.

3.6
A default constructor is the constructor that is assigned to a class whose constructor was not defined by the
programmer. When a default constructor is utilized by an object, the instance values are given their default value.
The default value of char, int, long, byte, float, double, and short is 0. The one for booleans is "false"

3.7
The purpose of instance variables is to save information that belongs to an object, and specifically to that object.

3.8
Because both belong to the java.lang package, which is  automatically imported to every Java application.

3.9
A program could use class Scanner without importing it by using the fully qualified class name. In the case of 
scanner, it would be:
java.util.Scanner input = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);

3.10
A class might provide a set method and a get method for an instance variables to execute "information hiding" which
protects the information of an object from tampering by external classes. This way, the value of the variable cannot 
be set to a wrong value or the value of the variable can be displayed with a specific format.
